    "description": "Chef counters are a treat, but a seat in front of Chef Kazushige Suzuki feels like a best-kept secret. The room has a presence of its own, notable in scale and hidden away in the back past a cocktail bar. Friendly as ever and seemingly never in a hurry, the chef sources fish entirely from Japan and keeps his nigiri traditional with little more adornment than a brushing of nikiri.Other dishes that bookend the meal flex far more creativity and panache. Hokkaido hairy crab with capellini and shiso or snow trout marinated in koji for seven days are uniquely satisfying, while beef sourced from Japan makes regular appearances. At the meal’s end, disbelief may turn into wonder as guests dive into apple sorbet boldly topped with Yamazaki 12 whisky."

The kitchen, led by Danish chef Ronny Emborg, runs with a quiet tranquility that forms a sharp contrast to the boisterous playlist, which helps keep the room from feeling stuffy. The menu comprises numerous beguiling courses with global accents, featuring subtle flavors and deftly weaving together both delicacy and richness. A dish of minute, briny shigoku oysters strikes an intriguing balance between vegetal and fruit notes when matched with kiwi and cucumber, while a perfectly cooked morsel of halibut is bolstered with an impeccable buttery shrimp bisque."

The product is whole and luscious every time, which is all the more reason why the nigiri sees little beyond a dot of wasabi or a dab of nikiri. Regulars, of which there are many, are treated to special pieces throughout the evening and will recognize some of his signature dishes, like hairy crab dressed with Japanese black vinegar, as well as his unrivaled tamago, which tastes as perfect as it looks."

From there, the tasting menu unfolds to reveals delights such as slivers of raw striped jack with white kimchi and chilled fish bone broth; gorgeously crisped octopus with gochujang aioli; and dry-aged Arctic char in a pool of kimchi and red curry sauce. This is cooking that is highly original, impeccably executed, and enormously satisfying; a meal that makes you involuntarily nod to yourself while you’re eating."

Charred carrots with razor clams and coconut curry as well as beef carpaccio with bagna cauda and lavash impress as well. Entrees like the jang-glazed pork katsu are begging to be shared."

Plump snow pea leaf dumplings are spiked with vibrant ginger and garlic and may be tailed by rich duck dumplings or an irresistibly flaky roast pork pie."

A selection of “gourmandises” showcases such exemplary classics as pike mousse quenelles dressed with lobster sauce or sautéed sweetbreads with cream and tarragon. Lamb is a celebration of springtime as a perfectly pink chop accompanied by braised neck and roasted young carrots. Desserts always please, as in an evening special of Chartreuse-spike crème brûlée."

In some ways, there are no surprises: He works meticulously and at his own pace, slicing fish flown in from Japan three times a week. His rice is defined and generally warm, and his uni and caviar sandwich as well as his double and triple-layer tuna nigiri are still signatures. There’s just one thing: the price is steep, but that doesn’t faze his regulars, of which there are many. But regular or not, he treats everyone like a guest of his home."

    "description": "On the edge of Chinatown, Chef Fidel Caballero is not holding anything back. Whether you sit at the kitchen counter for the ambitious tasting menu or order à la carte in the boisterous dining room, the cooking is a singularly original and bold celebration of Mexican cuisine. If anything, there must be an order of sourdough tortillas somewhere on the table. Made with Sonoran wheat and chicken fat, these delicate, perfectly griddled discs served with recado negro butter will lock in a return visit. Better yet, this won’t be the only course worth returning for. The likes of lobster nicuatole, black cod with salsa Veracruzana, and sweetbreads with bitter almond foam make for lasting impressions. From the bar, find Mexican spirits and natural wines."

Behind is the kitchen that unlike the décor, exceeds all expectations. Look beyond the Americanized standbys and go for dishes with flavors that are fully realized. Classic-meets-comfort in the laab, featuring fried, not ground, chicken; or turkey- and mushroom-stuffed cabbage with a fragrant broth.Breakfast runs all day, so indulge in the Thai tea French toast; or for that matter, the beverage carte, which is yet another sample of this team's resourcefulness."

A salad of pea shoots is deceptive in its sophistication thanks to roasted hazelnuts, aged goat cheese and a blizzard of freshly cracked black pepper. Marinated potatoes tango with thinly sliced onions and fried rock shrimp. Fish is a must; swing for the seabream cooked until the skin is crisp as a chip and then covered in sweet Habanada peppers. Whether you’re waiting to get in, sitting at a table or bar, or cooking, everyone is elbow to elbow, and all too happy to stay a little while longer."

Looks aside, the cooking offers a fresh take on Cantonese favorites using top-rate products. Pan-seared pot stickers get their boost from a Berkshire pork and chive filling. Fried tiger shrimp slicked in mayonnaise has never been more appealing. Also worth an order is the salt and pepper fried chicken. The platter comes with fluffy scallion biscuits and a chili-plum jam that should be bottled and sold commercially."

Think tender beef shank buried under a refreshing herb salad or perfect fried cubes of tofu dusted in salt and pepper. One can’t-miss entrée is branzino fried until golden brown and served in a fantastic sweet and sour sauce. A unique feature here is the wine program—it's serious business with a long, thoughtful list and Zalto glasses to boot. With so much to order, your small table fills up quickly, and the small dining room gets busy in a hurry. It’s all part of the charm."

A simple-seeming salad is anything but, with a blend of fresh and pickled iceberg lettuce with roasted celtuce, crispy puffed rice, and labneh thathits every mark. Then, a single yeasted donut is filled with a tomato, topped with smoked feta, and finished with concassé cherry tomatoes for an inventive take on a single ingredient.Dessert, too, follows in the same imaginative vein, with savory onions making their way into sweet dishes. A meal of this caliber is a true experience, and guests are sure to leave feeling nourished."

    "description": "This boisterous SoHo alcove is an ideal place to convene with friends over exquisite nibbles and quenching cocktails. The talented chef behind this operation, Ignacio Mattos, is unfaltering and impressively consistent in his creative renditions of such bold and iconic dishes as ricotta dumplings with mushrooms and Pecorino Sardo. The menu also offers an array of shareable plates that changes regularly, like the mound of warm crab cloaked by shaved celeriac. Dinner might kick off with perfect, sashimi-grade tuna pounded thin and dressed with a dollop of inky pil pil sauce or enticingly plated fried arroz negro scattered with tender squid and hazelnut-studded romesco."

Dhamaka, which means “explosion” in Hindi, is a bold love letter to the country’s more rustic dishes, many of which are drawn from the owner’s childhood. Where else have you had smoky goat belly flecked with coriander seeds and wrapped in cedar wood? How often does your mutton come in a clay pot filled with a deliciously dark chili oil and an entire bulb of roasted garlic? The kitchen grinds many of its spices daily, and the crowds have been quick to recognize such attention to detail. Tables are comically small but bring friends anyway."

Inside, Executive Chef Hideo An may be found working his skills like a master pianist—turning, fanning, saucing and brushing. It's a pristine workspace and the menu is a tribute to the yakitori tradition. Binchotan charcoal plays as vital a role as the fowl itself, with the aroma becoming one with the space and skewer.Chilled kombu-poached chicken is a succulent first bite. Vegetables, too, get their due—as in charred cipollini onion or agedashi tofu."

The team works with a solid foundation of Korean flavors and from there, springboards into uncharted waters. Creative, bold dishes—all of which beg to be shared—run up and down this menu. Those wanting to stick to something more familiar will not leave disappointed. Littleneck clams and house-made sweet potato soojebi bathed in a savory butter and pepper-tinged broth is a satisfying start, followed by tender medallions of grilled Iberico pork galbi resting in a pool of spicy red chili paste."

A compact menu keeps things tight with around ten dishes, but it's sprinkled with widely appealing Southern- and Korean-minded tapas-style plates. The cooking is straightforward and earnest with bold flavors. They're having plenty of fun from start to finish with items such as Seoul’sbury steak with galbi jus and gruyere grits, shrimp toast rolls and banana pudding with misugaru and meringue. Baby back ribs with a harissa glaze and plum coulis are slap-your-grandma good."

A punky soundtrack, a natural wine list and staff that will never judge you for over-ordering — what’s not to love?"

In fact, diners can expect a wonderful and surprising meal with an eye towards finesse.From lush hamachi with shiso pepper-saturated Meyer lemon curd to juicy-crispy chicken roulade over a puree of miso and spicy mole, this kitchen team treats its top-quality ingredients with refined techniques. Inspired by his time in Arizona and at Bar Uchu, Chef Clonts prepares a taco with soft ajitama, fried potato and smoked trout roe; as well as a hand roll full of caviar and rice."

Kick off the meal with a delightfully crunchy Burmese pancake filled with vegetables and toasted sesame seeds but don't miss the house-made roti with rich, creamy potato curry. Kaut swe thoke, or yellow noodle salad, is another hit with tender noodles in a curry sauce studded with chicken, but no matter your selection, the flavors are bold, and the portions are perfect for sharing."

The pasta is a high point, revealing a duo of bowls which may feature dense, toothsome cavatelli glossed with a sauce of scallop, nori and parmesan; or xiao long bao-inspired agnolotti filled with ginger-spiced pork. The lobster three ways is also a treat and showcases the cleverly minded ethos of this cuisine."

Little tarts stacked with poblano peppers and guanciale give way to a single boiled potato coated in a Huancaína-inspired sauce flecked with caviar.

There are just 18 counter seats and a table for six here where the crew plates contemporary French dishes. Sea scallops seared a la plancha and plated with a saffron sauce dotted with Amaretto is a clever play on flavors. Madai grilled over binchotan gives the dense, silken fish a gorgeously crisped skin, while thinly shaved Comte cheese, aged 36-months, is paired with honey ice cream for a delightful contrast of savory and sweet."

A dish of asparagus alternates between green and white that is as artful as it is delicious, while a Jerusalem bagel, piping hot and served with olive oil and a sprinkling of seeds, is a knockout, even in a city well known for its beloved bagels. Bone-in beef short rib impresses with its tender, flavorful meat.The interior has a celebratory ambience—snag a seat at the counter for views of the bar and open kitchen."

Some opt for the dry pot in which diners customize their ingredients—meat, seafood, vegetables, rice—and degree of spiciness. The possibilities here are nearly infinite. Those who aren’t up for making so many decisions swing for Sichuan classics. Recent highlights include the cold husband and wife appetizer (braised beef and tripe), warm dan dan noodles, and a particularly elegant white fish with pickled vegetables. Nothing is an intense barn-burner in terms of spiciness."

Recent highlights have smoked trout mousse sandwiched between squares of lemon pound cake for a dish that is equal parts smoky, earthy, and sweet. A half-moon shaped pie crust studded with roasted shredded duck is a comforting dish served alongside a bright salad of mixed greens and diced orange in a citrus vinaigrette.Popular with industry types, it's wise to make reservations, or be prepared to wait."

Co-owner and mini-mogul, Bon Yagi, favors authenticity over flash in his establishments. And here he employs that traditional aesthetic to sweet perfection—along with a graceful, but simply appointed dining space; and quiet, well-timed service.A meal might begin with uni and grated mountain yam, kissed with wasabi and crispy, toasted nori. Then, transition to a seasonal noodle dish like warm soba mingled with plump, pickled oysters, mountain yam, cilantro and tempura root vegetables."

Brooks Headley's first-come, first-served spot, with vintage diner vibes, is squarely in the middle of the East Village and the new menu is equal parts quirky and contemporary, and fully vegetarian (even sometimes vegan). It's very creative, as in sweet and sour beets over jalapeño cream cheese and pretzels. Yes, it sounds weird, but it works. Cabbage filled with sticky rice and oyster mushrooms has plenty of character, and the burger crafted from quinoa, chickpeas, carrots and walnuts is how they made their name. All of the desserts are worth trying, especially the peanut butter pie and the seared malt cake with house-made cream cheese gelato that punches way above its weight."

Their personality is evident in dishes such as daikon vichyssoise with wakame butter-braised greens and gently poached salmon. Dry-aged fluke topped with apple ice in a sweet soy sauce holds its own, while the duo of uni and the mellow, dry-aged mackerel with yuzu kosho are two standouts from the nigiri course. Desserts, like the amazake and the corn gelato with caviar, round out the singular experience."

The menu is teeming with ideas, and dishes arrive with all the right levels of spice, heat, depth, and nuance. “Jalebi Chaat” is a savory, textural playground with chickpeas, beetroot, and a sweet and sour yogurt. There must be butter chicken, which comes doused in a complex tomato makhani sauce. There must also be lamb shank biryani, portioned for a party and spiced to the hilt. Everything is designed to be shared so plan accordingly."

Consider starting with a plate of tempura-battered delicata squash with black garlic-infused labneh or golden-brown fried hamachi and shrimp boudin with Thai chili mayo before diving into the likes of Ibérico pork steak. Tamarind-glazed and grilled, it's served over a bed of coconut creamed spinach and okra and sided by a bowl of roasted potatoes with sauce choron.A generous selection of regional wines highlights small producers to match the cooking."

Instead, they are sent out in a sensible order, for the benefit of the diner rather than the convenience of the kitchen.The cuisine is nominally influenced by the Costa Brava, but its reach is far greater than that and the tapas are especially refined. Scrambled eggs with uni is a must, while confit goat will make you question why you don’t see more of it on other menus. This is food to cure what ails you."

These grills quietly work throughout the evening, searing off premium cuts such as tenderloin, short rib, and ribeye that are kept in a dry-aging chamber in full view of the dining room. But know that there is more at play here than just beef. The likes of uni, caviar, truffles, and crab make appearances, and the kitchen has no qualms about stacking such luxury on top of one another. Recent highlights include a croustade of baesuk, jujube, and tofu as well as bone broth with radish."

The soupless khao soi with beef tossed in a Chiang Mai-style curry is arguably the most successful riff on the menu, followed closely by a very light yet bold green curry that comes paired with a strikingly tender grilled chicken thigh and a bowl of purple rice berry. Pay close attention to specials: Fried branzino with fried garlic and chili sauce was a bone-in affair worth all the fuss and more."

    "description": "Eating here is serious business, but happily the place isn’t blighted by a monastic atmosphere—a contented buzz fills the room, helped along by the chefs who deliver the dishes themselves.Chef Fredrik Berselius and his ace team delight diners with their highly accomplished Nordic cuisine. Local products are woven into the seasonal tasting, and items like prawn shells and venison bones are transformed into luscious sauces that enhance each plating. Creme royale with claw of lobster, trout roe and essence of elderflower is a dish to dream about, while venison from New York is perfectly minimalist with morel mushroom, wild leek and a delicate jus."

(Downstairs is their ersatz speakeasy, Undercote.)First-timers should go for the “Butcher’s Feast” featuring different cuts of beef, an egg soufflé, and enough banchan to cover your table. Meats are first presented raw for you to admire; your server then oils the grill and expertly cooks them. A supporting cast of kimchi and ssamjang merely elevate their flavor."

Have you ever seen a banchan as minimalist and as impactful as this one? Probably not. Dinner typically ends with a glazed Korean-style donut and a silky-smooth orb of ice cream. All the while, this slim and sleek restaurant is right at home being in such close proximity to the Flatiron Building thanks to its soaring ceilings, sultry lighting and a packed dining room humming with energy."

His intentionality delivers in the form of excellent, seasonal product and a fine-tuned parade of nigiri, for which the rice is refreshed repeatedly. Prepared dishes like binchotan-seared sawara with citrus sauce, shiso, and nori or even a restorative cup of dashi with mushrooms also show distinction."

A quenelle of tonburi, mimicking caviar, plated with horseradish cream and accompanied by a radish tostada with a swipe of pumpkin seed butter is simply stunning. Toothsome braised seitan, wrapped in spinach and dressed with morels, is amplified with luscious sauce work.Desserts, perhaps a frozen cherry blossom and rose confection dressed with strawberries, are equally accomplished."

    "description": "Eating underground in the subway system may not sound appealing, but that hasn't stopped Chef Dae Kim. In the heart of Koreatown at Herald Square behind a code-locked door, find a black marble counter that stretches the length of the room. Every chef is armed with tweezers to manage and primp gorgeous dishes that are largely contemporary in their design. Seafood is a serious focus with the likes of crab, fluke, clams, and mackerel. The restaurant’s signature is obvious once you spot the squab dry aging in a fridge. Against the backdrop of 80s hits playing overhead, a chef holds the bird up and repeatedly ladles hot oil over it in the style of Peking duck. It’s a defining reminder that in New York City, anything can happen anywhere."

Settled into a large warehouse in Red Hook with an industrial feel thanks to concrete floors, an exposed wood ceiling, and wood tables and chairs, it may be a bit of a journey from Manhattan, but it's worth it. Order at the counter, where they slice your meat and serve it on metal sheet-trays. Can't decide? Get the black pepper rubbed brisket, with meat that's tender and juicy. Sides—especially the collard greens mixed with shredded smoked pork and a velvety mac and cheese topped with breadcrumbs to order—are nonnegotiable. But don't forget about dessert. Their banana pudding benefits from a fresh crumble of vanilla wafers and is one dreamy-creamy bite after another."

Garlic knot monkey bread is topped with dollops of Parmesan butter. Pastas get an equal dose of creativity, as seen in the bucatini naporitan with diced porcini mushrooms and nardello peppers along with Japanese pork sausage links shaped to resemble baby octopuses. Finally, marble olive cake may look typical but it's anything but, with a salty-sweet combination that brings it all home."

Fried rabbit with ramp agrodolce is a meal on its own, but you’ll also want to order some thick toast piled on with mussels and pancetta and served in a knockout Calabrian chili butter.

    "description": "This particular stretch that runs along the southern edge of Bryant Park sports an unusual number of Sichuan restaurants. Among them, Peppercorn Station is easy to spot, standing out with its cheery, brightly lit interior. The menu runs a decent length and offers a comfortable collection of favorites designed for sharing. Fish fillet with pickled cabbage is a must-order with its golden, numbing broth, as is the mapo tofu that’s been turbo-charged with fermented black beans. Sliced pork belly with garlic-chili sauce is a classic starter. Far from aggressive, this efficient kitchen is fairly even keeled when it comes to chilis and spice levels, and seasons just enough to nudge the sinuses. The restaurant has a second location in Jersey City."

The room is a box of luxury and sparkles as bright as ever under the spotlights, with most guests seated at a glossy walnut counter that wraps around a brigade of cooks who have nowhere to hide. The team works quickly, sending out a volley of delicate tarts and bites that showcase skill and refinement. Highlights have included a beach glass oyster atop a vibrant bright green aguachile and a single scallop topped with caviar in a vin jaune sauce. All the while, an excellent service team keeps close watch from all corners of the room."

The owner benefited from years at Jean-Georges’ empire, and that intelligence and experience is conveyed through the smart accents and whimsical menu that begins with Italian ingredients. Peppers stuffed with chopped salami, cheese, and topped with breadcrumbs make for a nice opener. Then, take a chance on the non-traditional but utterly fantastic pizza combinations, such as the St. Louis, layering a proper crust with meats, pickled peppers and Midwestern Provel cheese."

Churros with acacia honey and chocolate atole sauce are just right."

Rice is treated with reverence; seasoned to suit and complement the range of fish.

Chef Daniel Boulud and co-executive chef Will Nacev skillfully prepare a contemporary, globally inflected carte dominated by seafood and vegetable-focused items.

The variety of excellent seafood, largely sourced from Toyosu Market, is impressive, and even devoted sybarites will leave satisfied.

The garden outside will transport you to a trattoria in Umbria—on a dime. The well-edited menu spins to the season but start with a spiedini (skewer) or dish for the table to share. Do not miss their expertly prepared pasta dishes like ondine, with shrimp in a kicky tomato sauce, then follow it up with an entree like the grilled branzino with cauliflower pieces, roasted grapes, wilted spinach, almond puree, and verjus. Tiramisu is a classic send-off."

    "description": "The exterior pays homage to New York's beloved bodegas, but the light-filled interior has a crisp, modern vibe thanks to glossy blonde wood tables, exposed brick walls and a small, polished bar that's perfect for both solo diners and couples. This bright little spot aims to showcase Taiwan's culinary landscape with a fresh perspective. Don’t miss briny clams in a thick bath of Shaoxing rice wine, bobbing with cubes of butternut squash and red kabocha. This may be paired with soft bao—their unique twist is as addictive as it is sloppy—and tailed by thick and chewy zha jiang mian (noodles simmered with tender lamb, chili oil, and Sichuan peppercorn).A word to the wise: scallion pancakes accompany a host of items here, so skip the appetizer order."

    "description": "Hiding behind a banchan shop in Long Island City, this chef’s counter is as much a classroom as it is a restaurant. Chef Hooni Kim is a worthy guide as he builds a deeply personal menu around traditional Korean ingredients that he’s been wild fermenting and aging for the last decade. Dazzling versions of doenjang, gochujang, ganjang and ssamjang shine with silky tofu, fried pancakes, Miyazaki beef and Niman Ranch pork. He brings the room together and impresses with carefully calibrated dishes that appear strikingly minimalist. Details are impressive, and many of the service pieces are handmade from Korean clay. An unassuming bowl of rice with kimchi is an homage to his mentor. It is a poignant finale that looks rather ordinary but has long-lasting impact."

A bowl of finely diced raw steelhead trout is topped with pickled cherry tomatoes and cucumber with a tomato and basil foam, then Iberico pork is done three ways, from char siu and ssamjang to skewered with pickled apple. Blackberry lime sorbet with a Calpico and smoked vanilla oil foam and mezcal-soaked blackberries is the last hurrah."

Chefs work swiftly, moving from one roll to the next with nowhere to hide in this kitchen, flanked by counter seats on all sides. A tray of banchan and seafood closes out the meal."

Nothing blasts of heat here, so spice junkies are unlikely to break a sweat. Still, dishes like stewed fish fillet in hot chili soup arrive chock-full of minced garlic and channel the kind of fiery, umami-driven complexity we crave from this cuisine."

A play on tortellini en brodo uses paper-thin daikon radish as the \"pasta\" with crumbles of chicharrón, while chaquicán mille-feuille plates three layers of crisp crackers with Chilean chopped beef stew, Kabocha squash, and salsa verde for a delicious dish."

Flavors tend toward subtlety, with careful attention paid to textures, as in a silky soy milk custard matched with celery root, and savory, mildly spiced doubanjiang, or rich crab noodles with egg yolk and smoked tobiko.

Mexico City native Chef Arturo Leonar is the brains behind this exceptional riff, which mixes smoked trout, pico de gallo, and morita chile salsa to thrilling effect. His creativity even extends to other dishes, like taquitos de cangrego with sweet crabmeat and spicy salsa verde, as well as tamales with pork short rib and hoja santa with green mole Oaxaqueño sauce. Traditionalists may rest easy, as the subtly sweet mole coating chicken and enchiladas alike is bound to delight. Featuring a wrought-iron entrance door, the décor here is an absolute riot of color thanks to vibrant Mexican tiles surrounding the bar and artistic touches like that wall of ceramic butterflies."

The city’s love affair with Roberta’s seems stronger each year, and for good reason. Everything from the industrial space to the underground bohemian vibe epitomizes Brooklyn-chic. To begin, try the grilled baguettes covered in gigante beans and wilted dandelion green and topped with a soft poached egg before moving on to house-made bucatini tossed in a sungold tomato sauce. Of course, no visit is complete without one of their signature pies, and there's no going wrong with the famous original.Takeaway is always an option, so when the wait for a table is too long, snag a porchetta sandwich to go."

With walls painted cupcake pink, the kitchen has a real talent for bread. A thick slide of grilled potato pullman bread smeared with whipped chicken liver mousse topped with sour cherry caramel is a decadent treat, while a bowl of savory chicken broth bobbing with nokdeli, or Hungarian dumplings,will cure your ails. Yes, there are crepes — thin, delicate and none too sweet — but there’s also cheesecake."

Traditional dishes range from carnitas to ceviche, while creative dishes like chicken liver tostadas with candied kumquats or wagyu tongue empanadas are boundary pushing in the very best way. Lamb belly barbacoa served with a fresh green chepicha salsa is a simple but satisfying meal.

Both menus end in a grand dessert finale, like seasonal confections as well as such classics as a cappuccino semifreddo served with brioche donuts. They do offer supplements using lavish ingredients, but unless you’re richer than Croesus, you needn’t consider them. Just put yourself in the chef's hands and relish a meal that is balanced, varied and as seasonal as it gets."

Every decision, every move, is in the service of his distinctive style, which many have copied but none have mastered. Fragrant white and black truffles, pearly beads of Osetra caviar, and vibrant garnishes make for brilliant touches that straddle the line between luxury and excess. Few have both the imagination and the know-how to make foie gras nigiri, and few serve abalone so meltingly tender. It is a captivating experience that is singularly memorable."

Of course, nobody is complaining, thanks to the talents of Chef Reyna Morales, who hails from Mexico City and whose careful handling of familiar favorites goes a long way.Order the tacos tucked with crumbles of aromatic chorizo with a mild heat, while the chile relleno stuffed with creamy queso fresco and beans is a savory delight. This hangout also dishes out a satisfying mole, as seen in enchiladas stuffed with tender shredded chicken."

French technique is married with Asian flavors in a dish of three blue prawns with genmaicha tuille, and braised black sea bass with shiitake chutney, razor clams and a turmeric emulsion is memorable. For a light ending, the orange soufflé is bright and fragrant, especially when served with green cardamom ice cream."

The chef hails from Goa so start first with everything listed under the “Indo Portuguese” section. Lamb vindaloo, for instance, is a spicy, almost electric effort; while the Goan fish curry offers a more creamy, soothing bite. Cashew nuts, onions and fenugreek leaves work wonders in the methi curry. Classics like tandoori lamb chops marinated in yogurt and tamarind arrive wonderfully tender and expertly charred. Know that the kitchen takes its time, but the wait is well worth it."

If the burn is still unbearable, a pitcher of fresh watermelon juice and platter of flaky wok-tossed pineapple fried rice will set you right."

You could make a meal out of them, but then you’d be missing out on other specialties like fried lamb ribs seasoned with salt and pepper, stacked upon each other, and tossed with sautéed peppers. Steaming bowls of soup filled with noodles and comforting broths balance out sliced beef stir fried with tons of chili and large cubes of laphing. There’s more chili oil and a particularly ferocious hot sauce on the table for fearless spice hounds. Newcomers to this cuisine will appreciate a glossy menu with pages of clear photos of each dish."

Elmhurst is rich with talented Thai kitchens, but this one stands out for its fiery Isan-style cooking and prowess with seafood. It would be a mistake to show up without friends – or at least a very serious appetite. Dried shrimp and electric fish sauces are used with abandon on a menu that demands roaming. The house special larb ped udon pulls no punches with duck breast and fried duck skin jolted with fried lime leaves, mint, fried garlic and lime juice. Fried whole fish and bubbling hot pots tempt alongside excellent mainstays like prawn pad Thai and rotisserie chicken marinated in coriander and lemongrass."

Service is welcoming and attentive; and the food, most importantly, remains notably appetizing, in an area rich with competing Thai kitchens.The dizzyingly long menu features curries, fried rice, salads, and stir-fries. But look closely and you’ll find real gems, like yum pla duk, or a delicate weave of crispy catfish topped with tangy mango salad. Miang kha-na is an essential starter, mixing lime rinds, pork, and peanuts to brilliant effect. Bright, fiery, sharp, and spicy—this is Thai food in its most captivating form."

A Dia de los Muertos mural marks the wall opposite the open kitchen, where you’ll see industrious cooks working the grill and pressing house-made corn tortillas at a steady clip, which helps explain why they’re always so wonderfully tender and fresh. The tacos, like a spot-on al pastor, are of course excellent, as are homey offerings like braised chicken salsa verde enchiladas, smothered in melted queso Oaxaca. Save room for irresistible churros, served with chocolate- and cinnamon-caramel sauces."

Cushy pillows atop tree trunks act as chairs outside; inside, by the door, speakers blare with Latin beats.No need to debate what to order: leche de tigre is the star, paraded out in a giant martini glass filled with thinly sliced octopus, scallops, shrimp, and set afloat in an electrifying elixir of lime juice and ginger. But perhaps the most surprising dish of all is the pork tamal, hidden away in the corner of the carte. It is presented in a bamboo steamer and highlights the magic that is soft, fluffy masa."

The stylish restaurant group now runs multiple locations across the region, but this Flushing location is the original. Roast Beijing duck is a signature order that comes with thin pancakes on a silver tray. Fiery mapo tofu in a portion fit for four and one particularly thrilling sliced beef in golden pepper sauce are also must-orders. The grand setting is particularly attractive, ideal for dates and business meetings alike, thanks to a handsome Imperial design that mixes lacquered finishes, stone and greenery."

Chicken dumplings sitting in a pool of red chili sauce, and tender rolls of pork belly with sesame cold noodles are sensible starters for a meal that ramps up quite quickly thanks to a lightning-fast kitchen. In a flash, the table crowds with fiery bowls of mapo tofu and cauldrons of braised beef spiked with roasted chilies. Indeed, chilies, spices and heat are used to powerful, delicious effect."

Of course, what makes this place stand out is the tabletop grill, and you'll never go wrong with an order of beef short ribs marinated in a traditional Korean soy-based sauce, sided by romaine lettuce to build your own wraps. Fried rice with a variety of toppings is better when sizzled on the grill for a blend of crispy bits and tender rice."

Thin shavings of intensely smoked pork with garlic leaf is even better than what tea-smoked duck would taste like if made with bacon. The “tears in eyes” jelly salad may not induce actual tears, but it’s stocked with chillies, seeds, peanuts and is absolutely worth ordering."

Specials always impress, as do the homemade pastas, like the ravioli stuffed with braised Kobe beef, caramelized onions, black truffle and Fontina di Val'Osta. Battered cod fillet with hand-cut salt and vinegar fries is an upmarket take on fish and chips. Close out with pistachio semifreddo for a lush treat."
