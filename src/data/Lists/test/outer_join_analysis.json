        "description": "When Nico Russell retooled Oxalis, his seasonal tasting menu restaurant, into Cafe Mado, he wanted to better meet the needs of his Prospect Heights neighbors, who were looking for casual, flexible dining after the pandemic. What they got was a laid-back all-day cafe where Mr. Russell quietly juxtaposes refined technique and unorthodox flavor to build a menu of perennial favorites. His Caesar salad is boosted with horseradish. Fries are crispy strands perfumed with herbes de Provence and served with aioli. But it’s the ever-changing seasonal vegetable dishes that really show off his brilliance: bean purée with charred sweet peppers, a pea green salad and crescents of spiky fried pumpkin dusted with cherry blossom. Cafe Mado turns a neighborhood weeknight out into something truly special. MELISSA CLARK",

The large and welcoming space draws you in thanks to an impressive wood bar, sleek dining tables and a handsome penny-tiled floor. Both the tables and light olive-tinged walls are dressed minimally—the former with wildflowers and the latter with beautifully framed photos. The garden outside will transport you to a trattoria in Umbria—on a dime. The well-edited menu spins to the season but start with a spiedini (skewer) or dish for the table to share. Do not miss their expertly prepared pasta dishes like ondine, with shrimp in a kicky tomato sauce, then follow it up with an entree like the grilled branzino with cauliflower pieces, roasted grapes, wilted spinach, almond puree, and verjus. Tiramisu is a classic send-off."

His intentionality delivers in the form of excellent, seasonal product and a fine-tuned parade of nigiri, for which the rice is refreshed repeatedly. Prepared dishes like binchotan-seared sawara with citrus sauce, shiso, and nori or even a restorative cup of dashi with mushrooms also show distinction."

Specials always impress, as do the homemade pastas, like the ravioli stuffed with braised Kobe beef, caramelized onions, black truffle and Fontina di Val'Osta. Battered cod fillet with hand-cut salt and vinegar fries is an upmarket take on fish and chips. Close out with pistachio semifreddo for a lush treat."

French technique is married with Asian flavors in a dish of three blue prawns with genmaicha tuille, and braised black sea bass with shiitake chutney, razor clams and a turmeric emulsion is memorable. For a light ending, the orange soufflé is bright and fragrant, especially when served with green cardamom ice cream."

Further in, the adjoining dining area comes to life as a roaring wood-fire grill bathes tables in flickering amber hues. Fire here is the key to much goodness, starting with the fluffy, smoky polenta bread smeared with the likes of Calabrian chili butter or sesame and wild oregano. Other favorites include potato croquettes, lasagna, and, for especially big appetites, dry-aged steaks served with green garlic butter. Globe lights, handsome wood floors, and a friendly, casual cadre of servers add more warmth to an already welcoming space where everyone either is a regular or is about to become one."

The morcilla blood sausage is the journeyman’s favorite here, but the chicharrones, with that perfect ratio of meat to bubbled fried skin, are a perfect finger food for a group. The choices are vast, including pernil and cuajitos, fried intestines. It’s an assortment of cuts and parts so varied that it makes you wonder why the pig on the sign outside is smiling. There are pleasures other than the porcine, however. As you cast your eyes over the ample array of trays in the window, don’t leave behind the chicken pastelillos or the plantain fritters.

Richly influenced by her time in Northern France and a stint at Verjus in Paris, Ms. Faulkner has devised a concise, seasonal menu, which makes deft use of greenmarket bounty. In spring, that means saucers of morels for snacking (“instead of olives,” as the menu clarifies), a wild-leek tart with buttery crust, pink slices of rhubarb on a duck breast, and — arguably most thrilling — an ebullient, perfectly dressed salad filled with flowers, herbs and a many-textured multitude of vegetables. You can find good duck and morels easily enough in this city, but a salad this excellent is a much rarer bird. MELISSA CLARK",

The clam version could go toe-to-toe with New Haven’s best, and the caramelle piccanti, with cherry peppers, pepperoni and hot honey, tastes like a re-energized version of a cheese slice.

Far from aggressive, this efficient kitchen is fairly even keeled when it comes to chilis and spice levels, and seasons just enough to nudge the sinuses.

It's a tasting menu-only spot that doubles as a gallery; in fact, even the entrance is as artistic as the canvases lining its walls. There are just 18 counter seats and a table for six here where the crew plates contemporary French dishes. Sea scallops seared a la plancha and plated with a saffron sauce dotted with Amaretto is a clever play on flavors. Madai grilled over binchotan gives the dense, silken fish a gorgeously crisped skin, while thinly shaved Comte cheese, aged 36-months, is paired with honey ice cream for a delightful contrast of savory and sweet."

Garlic knot monkey bread is topped with dollops of Parmesan butter. Pastas get an equal dose of creativity, as seen in the bucatini naporitan with diced porcini mushrooms and nardello peppers along with Japanese pork sausage links shaped to resemble baby octopuses. Finally, marble olive cake may look typical but it's anything but, with a salty-sweet combination that brings it all home."

Arctic char tostada is a classic, but the scallop ceviche with cherry tomato is sure to garner a serious following. Other winners include meltingly tender birria, best with a side of warm tortillas.The handsome and none-too-sweet tres leches cake is a required finale."

It’s an undeniable feast for the senses, the energy made all the more palpable thanks to a long bar and an upbeat playlist. The kitchen, meanwhile, moves like clockwork with an approachably creative style. Gruyère fritters are a classic, as are the pillowy ricotta gnocchi, sometimes finished with vin jaune or, if the season is right, shaved white truffles. Charred carrots with razor clams and coconut curry as well as beef carpaccio with bagna cauda and lavash impress as well. Entrees like the jang-glazed pork katsu are begging to be shared."

This food has deep roots: Mr. Waxman cooked with Alice Waters at Chez Panisse in the 1970s, brought his New Californian style to go-go New York in the ’80’s and debuted his simple, Italian-accented Barbuto in the aughts at its first location in the West Village. Trends come and go, but his pan-fried gnocchi with crispy brussels sprouts remains a steady delight, and the deep-green kale salad has lost none of its uncanny umami. Start with a glass of wine and those citrus-scented, warm olives, then follow your heart. MELISSA CLARK",

        "description": "Sorry Texas, this \"yellow rose\" belongs to the bustling East Village and announces its arrival via a striped awning and bright green sign. Inside, it's quaint and vintage in every way. Amidst this setting of weathered wood and stained-glass chandeliers, diners can be found devouring Tex-Mex food with a focus on tacos and inspired cocktails. Flour tortillas are made in house daily and feature in a myriad of deliciously dressed-down creations—from the shredded chicken verde and barbacoa taco with avocado, cilantro, and spring onion to the heartier carne guisada. Skirt steak and pepper quesadilla is a sumptuous mainstay, but those with sweets on their mind should go straight for the nostalgic Texas sheet cake with candied pecans.-"

The house special larb ped udon pulls no punches with duck breast and fried duck skin jolted with fried lime leaves, mint, fried garlic and lime juice. Fried whole fish and bubbling hot pots tempt alongside excellent mainstays like prawn pad Thai and rotisserie chicken marinated in coriander and lemongrass."

Settled into a large warehouse in Red Hook with an industrial feel thanks to concrete floors, an exposed wood ceiling, and wood tables and chairs, it may be a bit of a journey from Manhattan, but it's worth it. Order at the counter, where they slice your meat and serve it on metal sheet-trays. Can't decide? Get the black pepper rubbed brisket, with meat that's tender and juicy. Sides—especially the collard greens mixed with shredded smoked pork and a velvety mac and cheese topped with breadcrumbs to order—are nonnegotiable. But don't forget about dessert. Their banana pudding benefits from a fresh crumble of vanilla wafers and is one dreamy-creamy bite after another."

Also explore dim sum, featuring pork- and crab-soup dumplings or caramelized, juicy and puffy pork buns. The Chinese sausage fried rice is a fragrant and wholly delicious treat.The attractive interior is festooned with wood furniture, dark walls, cozy lighting and a small bar up front.

If the price seems a bit higher than its competitors, you’ll find it’s worth it for dishes like sweet shrimp, rolled in rice paper and laced with dark soy sauce. Plump snow pea leaf dumplings are spiked with vibrant ginger and garlic and may be tailed by rich duck dumplings or an irresistibly flaky roast pork pie."

It's very creative, as in sweet and sour beets over jalapeño cream cheese and pretzels. Yes, it sounds weird, but it works. Cabbage filled with sticky rice and oyster mushrooms has plenty of character, and the burger crafted from quinoa, chickpeas, carrots and walnuts is how they made their name. All of the desserts are worth trying, especially the peanut butter pie and the seared malt cake with house-made cream cheese gelato that punches way above its weight."

But the roti, aptly described on the menu as a “flour handkerchief,” also work well. The dining room is a veritable museum of Sri Lankan culture, adorned with dozens of artifacts collected over the years by the Wijesinghe family, who own the restaurant.

At Okdongsik, a 13-seat counter on the edge of Koreatown, the chef Ok Dongsik replicates his Seoul restaurant specializing in dweji gomtang, a pork-based variation on Korean gomtang. Bronze bowls of rice and clear broth are topped with near-translucent slices of fatty heritage pork shoulder and a scattering of scallions. It’s stunningly simple, with an uncanny depth of flavor. In fact, there is only one other item on the menu, mandu stuffed with pork, glass noodles and tofu. They are delicious, but nowhere near as ethereal. MELISSA CLARK",

Whether you sit at the kitchen counter for the ambitious tasting menu or order à la carte in the boisterous dining room, the cooking is a singularly original and bold celebration of Mexican cuisine. If anything, there must be an order of sourdough tortillas somewhere on the table. Made with Sonoran wheat and chicken fat, these delicate, perfectly griddled discs served with recado negro butter will lock in a return visit. Better yet, this won’t be the only course worth returning for. The likes of lobster nicuatole, black cod with salsa Veracruzana, and sweetbreads with bitter almond foam make for lasting impressions. From the bar, find Mexican spirits and natural wines."

But perhaps the most surprising dish of all is the pork tamal, hidden away in the corner of the carte. It is presented in a bamboo steamer and highlights the magic that is soft, fluffy masa."

Behind the sleek marble bar, the chef Joshua Pinsky and his team prepare dishes that are beguiling in their simplicity and cunning in execution. The soft, plump shrimp cocktail tastes of sweetness and seawater. Fresh, delicate razor clams are gussied up with a tangle of pickled vegetables. With little more than a fridge and a binchotan grill as equipment, Mr. Pinsky isn’t doing much to his ingredients — and that’s the whole point. PRIYA KRISHNA",

Nothing is out of place and everything is custom made, from the staff’s suits to the handblown water vases.The plant-based menu is a bold vision of luxury dining and elevates the concept to unparalleled heights. The freshly baked, delicately crisped vegan roll presented with faux butter is a magical creation. A quenelle of tonburi, mimicking caviar, plated with horseradish cream and accompanied by a radish tostada with a swipe of pumpkin seed butter is simply stunning. Toothsome braised seitan, wrapped in spinach and dressed with morels, is amplified with luscious sauce work.Desserts, perhaps a frozen cherry blossom and rose confection dressed with strawberries, are equally accomplished."

All entrees like grilled duck with endive and black garlic puree come with banchan and a welcome bowl of rice and soup, which are kept warm in three cauldrons at the bar up front.

This menu is low-key but inspired, filled with craveable dishes you’d be happy come back for every week, served in an unfussy, convivial dining room. You’ll find seared summer squash with homemade chile crisp; springy noodles pan-fried with Japanese curry and tender greens; and fried cubes of lettuce-wrapped tilefish coated with jalapeño tartar sauce that give fish-taco vibes. Yet however comforting and almost familiar Ms. Cupps’s cuisine may seem, it retains a complex splendor, elevated by brilliant twists that spring from a foundation of classic technique.

        "description": "\"Simplicity is the peak of elegance\" seems a fitting adage for this stunning kaiseki counter. In Japanese, \"tsukimi\" means moon viewing (a harvest festival honoring the moon at its fullest and brightest); and following the moniker quite literally is a central motif of the moon. Illuminated shelves of ceramics and mirrored panels reinforce this light-bright aesthetic. Service is seamless and unaffected, enhancing the overall experience.The progression of the these whimsical, seasonal courses is strategic and imaginative. To start, chilled caviar with warm scrambled eggs and potato purée. Up next, chopped scallop matched with sea buckthorn sauce and a nori crisp for crunch.Beverage pairing is available, but stick to à la carte for an ace sake selection."

It’s a good omen in Long Island City, which isn’t known for its Asian cuisine but may be soon, thanks to Hupo. The sleek space is narrow and long, with dark hardwood floors and lofty ceilings.Such a quaint setting is an apt pairing for the small, focused menu that features regional favorites like spicy mapo tofu, house-made cold noodles slicked in a sweet and spicy chili oil, as well as Chungking spicy chicken. Nothing blasts of heat here, so spice junkies are unlikely to break a sweat. Still, dishes like stewed fish fillet in hot chili soup arrive chock-full of minced garlic and channel the kind of fiery, umami-driven complexity we crave from this cuisine."

The two-story space is light on amenities, with rustic wooden tables and short, backless stools, but the earpiece-wearing staff is as adept and meticulous as the food itself—and happy to dispense menu guidance to novices.While many associate Sichuan fare with buckets of numbing chili oil, these chefs tend to go light on the spice, letting complex flavors shine in dishes like whole fish slathered with sweet peppers or slivered pork in a vinegary garlic sauce. If the burn is still unbearable, a pitcher of fresh watermelon juice and platter of flaky wok-tossed pineapple fried rice will set you right."

Speedy servers steer diners through the varied menu—and perhaps even away from such delicacies as prawn mee, an exceptionally spiced and sour shrimp broth with noodles, pork, vegetables and bean sprouts floating in its goodness.Some know to stick to such faithful and deeply satisfying dishes as nasi lemak, which is a delightful combo of coconut rice, pickled veggies, crispy anchovies, curried chicken and hard-boiled egg. The chow kueh teow, with stir-fried noodles, tiger prawns and squid, is a go-to dish, while coconut batter-fried jumbo prawns are another winner."

A Dia de los Muertos mural marks the wall opposite the open kitchen, where you’ll see industrious cooks working the grill and pressing house-made corn tortillas at a steady clip, which helps explain why they’re always so wonderfully tender and fresh. The tacos, like a spot-on al pastor, are of course excellent, as are homey offerings like braised chicken salsa verde enchiladas, smothered in melted queso Oaxaca. Save room for irresistible churros, served with chocolate- and cinnamon-caramel sauces."

Yet this soaring space, with its dramatic bronze sculpture and delicate shades that flutter like eyelids, serves up more than just the look of luxury; the food is every bit as sumptuous. The prime rib is as plush as a sofa, the sauce on the pasta à la presse — theatrically prepared using a vintage silver duck press — is liquid gold, and the lemon chiffon cake is as sculptural as it is puckery. There may be no better expression of New York splendor (and no better bathroom to take a selfie). PRIYA KRISHNA",

Every decision, every move, is in the service of his distinctive style, which many have copied but none have mastered. Fragrant white and black truffles, pearly beads of Osetra caviar, and vibrant garnishes make for brilliant touches that straddle the line between luxury and excess. Few have both the imagination and the know-how to make foie gras nigiri, and few serve abalone so meltingly tender. It is a captivating experience that is singularly memorable."

The restaurant’s name, underscored by whimsical, poultry-themed décor, might lead you to think chicken is the star of the show. But it’s the rice that shines, infused with jasmine, pandan, lemongrass and shallots. The poached chicken is a close second, though, with a texture at once firm, yielding and floppy. Most if its flavor has been distilled into the aromatic golden broth served in cups alongside. Sip this slowly, breathing in the fragrant steam between bites, which you should season liberally with any and all of the three housemade dipping sauces (sesame soy, ginger-scallion, chile). If you’ve got an urge to fly beyond the bird, order the char siu pork belly, with its soy-stained skin and tender, spiced meat. MELISSA CLARK",

The room has a presence of its own, notable in scale and hidden away in the back past a cocktail bar. Friendly as ever and seemingly never in a hurry, the chef sources fish entirely from Japan and keeps his nigiri traditional with little more adornment than a brushing of nikiri.Other dishes that bookend the meal flex far more creativity and panache. Hokkaido hairy crab with capellini and shiso or snow trout marinated in koji for seven days are uniquely satisfying, while beef sourced from Japan makes regular appearances. At the meal’s end, disbelief may turn into wonder as guests dive into apple sorbet boldly topped with Yamazaki 12 whisky."

Many of the courses arrive with a story about their creation, making dishes like langoustine with red gooseberries and quail with morels feel personal and immediate, but never academic. They’re also visually stunning enough to give you a pang when you cut in. Such is Aska’s ode to nature’s beauty: exquisite, ephemeral and delectable. MELISSA CLARK",

Entrees are where chef Rachanon Kampimarn shines brightest as he takes core flavors and delivers them with a certain level of flair. The soupless khao soi with beef tossed in a Chiang Mai-style curry is arguably the most successful riff on the menu, followed closely by a very light yet bold green curry that comes paired with a strikingly tender grilled chicken thigh and a bowl of purple rice berry. Pay close attention to specials: Fried branzino with fried garlic and chili sauce was a bone-in affair worth all the fuss and more."

        "description": "Hiding behind a banchan shop in Long Island City, this chef’s counter is as much a classroom as it is a restaurant. Chef Hooni Kim is a worthy guide as he builds a deeply personal menu around traditional Korean ingredients that he’s been wild fermenting and aging for the last decade. Dazzling versions of doenjang, gochujang, ganjang and ssamjang shine with silky tofu, fried pancakes, Miyazaki beef and Niman Ranch pork. He brings the room together and impresses with carefully calibrated dishes that appear strikingly minimalist. Details are impressive, and many of the service pieces are handmade from Korean clay. An unassuming bowl of rice with kimchi is an homage to his mentor. It is a poignant finale that looks rather ordinary but has long-lasting impact."

Those who aren’t up for making so many decisions swing for Sichuan classics. Recent highlights include the cold husband and wife appetizer (braised beef and tripe), warm dan dan noodles, and a particularly elegant white fish with pickled vegetables. Nothing is an intense barn-burner in terms of spiciness."

It arrives delicately breaded, fried and greaseless, with a marinara so flavorful and garlicky you’ll want to drink it once the last crunchy squid ring is gone. Prolong the joy by ordering any red-sauced pasta. Spaghetti with the zuppa di pesce comes nicely al dente under a generous jumble of clams, mussels, fish and shrimp, all succulent and perfectly cooked. Of course, as long as you’re here you should also get the clams, littlenecks and cherrystones served raw and ice-cold, the better to magnify their saline splendor. MELISSA CLARK",

Be sure to order the light and crispy sai-ua spring roll with flavorful Chiang Mai sausage and zabb hang, a bowl of rice noodles tossed with tender, sliced pork, meatball, and more in a homemade brown sauce.

Start with a plate of toast with “green sauce” (a pungent, anchovied salsa verde), then move on to seasonal dishes like pea leaves showered heavily with pecorino, and pork shoulder braised with olives until it practically melts. The sweet-toothed among us pine for Ms. Bloomfield’s British-accented desserts, and the sticky ginger cake soaked in cream is a very fine way to ride Sailor’s wave. MELISSA CLARK",

        "description": "Owner Bolun Yao's beloved grandmother serves as both the namesake and culinary inspiration for this stylish Hell's Kitchen hideaway, an unassumingly ambitious project that aims to reinterpret Chinese cuisine through the lens of Western fine dining. Chef Jakub Baster lends his experienced hand to the effort, composing elegant dishes that blend a wide array of Chinese flavors and ingredients with elements of French technique and a contemporary style. The results are simultaneously inventive and familiar. Flavors tend toward subtlety, with careful attention paid to textures, as in a silky soy milk custard matched with celery root, and savory, mildly spiced doubanjiang, or rich crab noodles with egg yolk and smoked tobiko. To finish, a reimagining of nian gao (sweet rice cake) is sure to delight."

The menu changes often but there are some fixtures, like egg rolls filled with Berkshire pork and wood ear mushrooms or the fried rice with Vietnamese mortadella and Chinese sausage.

The pasta is a high point, revealing a duo of bowls which may feature dense, toothsome cavatelli glossed with a sauce of scallop, nori and parmesan; or xiao long bao-inspired agnolotti filled with ginger-spiced pork. The lobster three ways is also a treat and showcases the cleverly minded ethos of this cuisine."

        "description": "Longtime fans of the previous tenant (Paet Rio) will be thrilled to know that little has changed under this new name. The interior is still as cozy as ever, like a long train car with wall-to-wall wood paneling and redolent of incense. Service is welcoming and attentive; and the food, most importantly, remains notably appetizing, in an area rich with competing Thai kitchens.The dizzyingly long menu features curries, fried rice, salads, and stir-fries. But look closely and you’ll find real gems, like yum pla duk, or a delicate weave of crispy catfish topped with tangy mango salad. Miang kha-na is an essential starter, mixing lime rinds, pork, and peanuts to brilliant effect. Bright, fiery, sharp, and spicy—this is Thai food in its most captivating form."

The savory and smoky kielbasa stands on its own, though whole grain mustard seals the deal. Raspberry and sweet cheese pierogi makes a sweet counterpart to the savory options but be sure to accompany each bite with a shot from their concise selection of Polish liquors."

Think tender beef shank buried under a refreshing herb salad or perfect fried cubes of tofu dusted in salt and pepper. One can’t-miss entrée is branzino fried until golden brown and served in a fantastic sweet and sour sauce. A unique feature here is the wine program—it's serious business with a long, thoughtful list and Zalto glasses to boot. With so much to order, your small table fills up quickly, and the small dining room gets busy in a hurry. It’s all part of the charm."

        "description": "It's old-world Bohemia, not hippie-chic, at this Czech beer hall located on the first floor of the National Bohemian Hall building. It exudes a classic European bar vibe with wood paneling, simple wood tables and vintage knick knacks. Naturally, beers and pilsners are the drink of choice, but for grape lovers, there is a nice European-focused wine list sprinkled with Czech wines. Hearty fare is definitely in store here. A large bowl of borscht arrives redolent of dill and is tangy and vibrant with a buttery finish, while grilled kielbasa is smoky and moist, sided by a mustard-forward potato salad. Dumplings litter the menu, even at dessert, where strawberry-filled dumplings topped with crumbled gingerbread are a delicious finale."

Chef Shin Chang-ho offers a Korean tasting menu that feels both traditional and contemporary and exudes calm, collected refinement. A deconstructed pheasant mandu with foie gras and morels is a remarkable feat while shrimp with perilla oil is a masterclass in confident, discreet cooking.

The specialties — the signature mutton chop and prime rib hash — are rightfully renowned. And the 140-year-old, oak-paneled atmosphere invites you to tuck in.

A somewhat cumbersome menu conceals the true talent behind this kitchen, which specializes in clearly defined, utterly delicious curries. The chef hails from Goa so start first with everything listed under the “Indo Portuguese” section. Lamb vindaloo, for instance, is a spicy, almost electric effort; while the Goan fish curry offers a more creamy, soothing bite. Cashew nuts, onions and fenugreek leaves work wonders in the methi curry. Classics like tandoori lamb chops marinated in yogurt and tamarind arrive wonderfully tender and expertly charred. Know that the kitchen takes its time, but the wait is well worth it."

The intimate space is outfitted with a backlit bar, bay windows, and comfortable purple seats. Service is fittingly unfussy yet deeply knowledgeable. Don’t miss the seared octopus served atop pork XO sauce or the lamb chops, served perfectly medium rare and finished with a shishito chimichurri, black pepper jus, and a dollop of onion soubise. Finally, deep-fried buns which arrive as Chinese “beignets” accompanied by vanilla ice cream laced with red bean paste, goat's milk caramel, and yuzu marmalade render dessert wholly unmissable."

The team works with a solid foundation of Korean flavors and from there, springboards into uncharted waters. Creative, bold dishes—all of which beg to be shared—run up and down this menu. Those wanting to stick to something more familiar will not leave disappointed. Littleneck clams and house-made sweet potato soojebi bathed in a savory butter and pepper-tinged broth is a satisfying start, followed by tender medallions of grilled Iberico pork galbi resting in a pool of spicy red chili paste."

The rigamarole is worth it, as the ambience at this Korean fried chicken spot is just plain fun. There are other items on the compact menu, but you're here for the chicken. Available as a \"bucket\" that includes chicken consommé to start, followed by two waves of different types of gluten-free fried chicken with house-made sauces, along with cold perilla seed noodles. Finally, yogurt soft serve completes the meal. Stick to the bucket for a reasonable bill, but splurge, add caviar and extras and it climbs quickly. Cocktails play into the theme, but champagne is the star, with a nice range of offerings by the glass, as well as full and half bottles for every budget."

Then comes the volley of skewers, with all parts of the bird from heart to tail grilled over charcoal until crisp, chewy and haloed with smoke.

Thin shavings of intensely smoked pork with garlic leaf is even better than what tea-smoked duck would taste like if made with bacon.

Attention to detail is the through line, from the rustic flea-market appointments to the seasonal Italian cooking and streamlined cocktail list with multiple Negronis. Rabbit is pan-fried to golden perfection, and vegetable dishes like caramelized twigs of salsify or tender poached fennel imbued with orange embody the nonchalant elegance that keep this inviting West Village spot packed from midmorning until late at night.

It manages to balance certified crowd-pleasers — like an irresistible disk of cheese-filled focaccia, a plump handmade ravioli stuffed with ricotta, and a bronze-skinned roast chicken with Marsala — with earthier, more complex offerings like plump sweetbreads and fried rabbit with shallots. Add a bottle from the wine director Lee Campbell’s thoughtful, natural-leaning list or a martini from the well-appointed cart, and toast to Mr. Tarlow’s successful sortie across the East River.

The hummus, whipped-cream fluffy, is buried under whole chickpeas and pickled onions and bathed with oil; the grilled-to-order laffa (a dinner-plate-size flatbread) arrives fingertip-burning hot and dramatically smeared with za’atar. Everything comes on small plates that do nothing to diminish the dishes’ outsize personalities — and that’s no joke. MELISSA CLARK",

Then, the main event begins in the traditional way with crispy shrimp legs. Dishes turned out of this kitchen usually vary according to the seasons, but could include the likes of wonderfully tender squid, succulent Hokkaido scallop, tender cauliflower, as well as snow crab wrapped in shiso leaf.

His career in the city spans two decades, and his commitment to edomae-style omakase has shaped this city’s sushi sensibility. He now finds himself in Tribeca behind a 10-seat counter made from gorgeous cedar wood. In some ways, there are no surprises: He works meticulously and at his own pace, slicing fish flown in from Japan three times a week. His rice is defined and generally warm, and his uni and caviar sandwich as well as his double and triple-layer tuna nigiri are still signatures. There’s just one thing: the price is steep, but that doesn’t faze his regulars, of which there are many. But regular or not, he treats everyone like a guest of his home."

Named for the town in Nara Prefecture where his father hails, there is a precise quality to every facet of this space—as in the hinoki counter (sourced from a 300-year-old tree) and hand-made chairs to the knives crafted by a master from Saga Prefecture.This meticulous approach is seen again in the presentation of dishes. Meals bring an element of theater, so much so that diners will find themselves leaning forward to absorb every detail—envision the dramatic removal of a glass dome to reveal a perfect piece of smoked salmon. The main event though just might be the nigiri, tailed by bruléed tamago."

Looks aside, the cooking offers a fresh take on Cantonese favorites using top-rate products. Pan-seared pot stickers get their boost from a Berkshire pork and chive filling. Fried tiger shrimp slicked in mayonnaise has never been more appealing. Also worth an order is the salt and pepper fried chicken.

These superlative gems are works of art that taste even better than they look. Pork soup dumplings are a bite-sized explosion of savory goodness, with fresh ginger, black vinegar and soy sauce; while perfectly crispy duck slices are served with wraps, hoisin, and cucumber for a deliciously classic rendition. Finish with simple vanilla ice cream.Happy Hour brings dumplings and wines (from a wonderfully surprising list) at a pretty price."

Don’t miss briny clams in a thick bath of Shaoxing rice wine, bobbing with cubes of butternut squash and red kabocha. This may be paired with soft bao—their unique twist is as addictive as it is sloppy—and tailed by thick and chewy zha jiang mian (noodles simmered with tender lamb, chili oil, and Sichuan peppercorn).A word to the wise: scallion pancakes accompany a host of items here, so skip the appetizer order."

The menu is lengthy and there are plenty of familiar favorites to choose from, but first try asking the server about some regional highlights. Chicken soaked in Shaoxing wine; stir-fried rice cakes with pork and leeks; and peach resin stew with crabmeat are all worth consideration. Oddly enough, a recent stunner came straight out of the Sichuan lexicon: House special fish stew with Sichuan peppercorns is a must-order feast.There is also a second location in Flushing."

Starters also flaunt refinement, including the crisp-seared gyoza packed with pork, ginger, and set in a cast-iron pan sizzling with ramen broth. For something lighter but equally heartwarming, go for the kale salad dressed with an umami-packed vinaigrette and garnished with sweet pomegranate and grapefruit segments. Finish with mango milk shaved ice topped with a dollop of honey cream.The décor is sleek, featuring high ceilings, concrete floors, and everything necessary to make it a slam-dunk among the midtown lunch crowds."

The narrow space does not at all match the kitchen’s outsized talents and imaginative plates, which put seafood front and center. Consider starting with a plate of tempura-battered delicata squash with black garlic-infused labneh or golden-brown fried hamachi and shrimp boudin with Thai chili mayo before diving into the likes of Ibérico pork steak. Tamarind-glazed and grilled, it's served over a bed of coconut creamed spinach and okra and sided by a bowl of roasted potatoes with sauce choron.A generous selection of regional wines highlights small producers to match the cooking."

Many kitchens boast about using fresh ingredients, but Shmoné takes that philosophy to another level, creating a new menu daily (though some items stick around). The cooking often relies on the grill and dishes aren't repeated but they're certainly memorable. A dish of asparagus alternates between green and white that is as artful as it is delicious, while a Jerusalem bagel, piping hot and served with olive oil and a sprinkling of seeds, is a knockout, even in a city well known for its beloved bagels. Bone-in beef short rib impresses with its tender, flavorful meat.The interior has a celebratory ambience—snag a seat at the counter for views of the bar and open kitchen."

Whipped ricotta with brown butter, sage, and honey is a sweet staple, as is the fantastic hummus topped with tender lamb shawarma. Sharing is the name of the game here, from the vibrant market salads to charred skewers like kofta with pine nut, short rib with cabbage, and halloumi with green tahini. All of it arrives properly seasoned and spiced from a shockingly small kitchen. Though reservations are scarce, walk-ins can find refuge at the bar."

Little tarts stacked with poblano peppers and guanciale give way to a single boiled potato coated in a Huancaína-inspired sauce flecked with caviar. Find spice and smoke deployed across a range of local fish and American wagyu, with one highlight being a grilled, dry-aged sirloin paired with a stunning cabbage puree. Service matches the setting, quiet and calm in all the right ways."

A tofu flower, expansive as a sea anemone in its bowl of subtle matsutake mushroom broth, leaves you wondering how something so delicate can possess such umami depth.

Perfectly executed dishes like plush, handmade agnolotti with winter squash, amaretti and brown butter, and butter-poached lobster with an explosively spicy black pepper and ginger jus prove that in some kitchens, two chefs are better than one.

        "description": "From the team behind Rosella, this diminutive spot with a sprinkling of seats steers clear of the familiar minimalist design, favoring bold colors and eye-catching details (note the custom pottery displayed behind the counter).These confident chefs deliver an omakase that is a showpiece of sustainable sourcing, much of it local—even the rice is sourced from New York state. Their personality is evident in dishes such as daikon vichyssoise with wakame butter-braised greens and gently poached salmon. Dry-aged fluke topped with apple ice in a sweet soy sauce holds its own, while the duo of uni and the mellow, dry-aged mackerel with yuzu kosho are two standouts from the nigiri course. Desserts, like the amazake and the corn gelato with caviar, round out the singular experience."

Begin with the usual but very exquisite banchan-like pickled turnips, fermented bean paste soup, and specially aged house kimchi—funky, garlicky, and a total pleasure. Of course, what makes this place stand out is the tabletop grill, and you'll never go wrong with an order of beef short ribs marinated in a traditional Korean soy-based sauce, sided by romaine lettuce to build your own wraps. Fried rice with a variety of toppings is better when sizzled on the grill for a blend of crispy bits and tender rice."

Recent highlights include Norwegian langoustine with shiso and caviar, Japanese akami tuna with tomato water dashi, and sawara with yuzu kosho. A masterful hand with sauces and a sense for harmonious combinations demonstrate a refined sensibility. An eager service team oversees the spacious room where counter and table seating alike offer a prime vantage point for watching this kinetic kitchen."

Txikito’s wide-ranging cooking may originate on the Bay of Biscay, but it doesn’t stay there, driven by a relentless verve and curiosity that couldn’t be more Basque. MELISSA CLARK",

You may become fast friends with your neighbor at this tiny space, but with a warm welcome from the hospitable staff, it's all part of the vibe. A compact menu keeps things tight with around ten dishes, but it's sprinkled with widely appealing Southern- and Korean-minded tapas-style plates. The cooking is straightforward and earnest with bold flavors. They're having plenty of fun from start to finish with items such as Seoul’sbury steak with galbi jus and gruyere grits, shrimp toast rolls and banana pudding with misugaru and meringue. Baby back ribs with a harissa glaze and plum coulis are slap-your-grandma good."

Start your meal with yache pajun, a savory and crisp pancake filled with vegetables. Not to be missed is the daegu jorim, cod fish braised in a luscious, sweet soy sauce served with tender daikon radish and jammy onions. Beat the heat with the mak-gutsu, chilled and icy soba noodles served with chili vinaigrette, then wind down over warm, light and fluffy beignets along with a sip from their wonderful selection of sparkling spirits. Affable service augments the dining experience at this local favorite."

        "description": "Chef Amanda Cohen was an advocate of vegetable- and plant-based cooking long before it was cool, and her Lower East Side flagship continues to flourish as a pioneer in ethical eating with refined technique. Now, it enters an exciting new chapter in its long history. A single tasting menu yields a breadth of dishes that never masquerade as meat. A simple-seeming salad is anything but, with a blend of fresh and pickled iceberg lettuce with roasted celtuce, crispy puffed rice, and labneh thathits every mark. Then, a single yeasted donut is filled with a tomato, topped with smoked feta, and finished with concassé cherry tomatoes for an inventive take on a single ingredient.Dessert, too, follows in the same imaginative vein, with savory onions making their way into sweet dishes. A meal of this caliber is a true experience, and guests are sure to leave feeling nourished."

The extensive menu at this Upper West Side elder can seem daunting for a first-timer, but regulars know there are no wrong choices. Barney Greengrass has been serving smoked fish and other appetizing staples with curmudgeonly panache since 1908. Maybe the matzo ball soup could arrive a little hotter, the tables wobble a little less, the line move a little faster. Nu? There’s no better spot for a taste of O.G. New York Jewish charm, especially when it’s expressed in a plate of lox, eggs and onions. MELISSA CLARK",

Tucked under the Manhattan Bridge, the restaurant serves exactly the right food in exactly the right place at exactly the right time — which, here, is all day long. There’s brilliant breakfast food on offer at all hours, like the gone-viral, feather-light honey butter pancakes and Chinatown egg and cheese. The kitchen has mastered lunchtime grails like the classic tuna melt, offered along with Asian rice and beans, and a supremely beefy burger topped with mushroom gochujang. Did I mention the egg and cheese comes stuffed into a sesame-scallion milk bun? It’s always the right time for that. MELISSA CLARK",

Pasta is a must, as in the conchiglie with a luscious clam sauce. Shelled clams, bits of bacon, and sesame breadcrumbs complete the delightful preparation. Lamb is a springtime treat when dressed with green garlic persillade and young onion soubise. Caramelized apple atop buttery cake with crème fraîche and green apple brunoise is a fine finale to the array of impressive cuisine offered here."
