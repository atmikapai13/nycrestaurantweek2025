I've seen a ton of Reddit posts disparaging restaurant week, lamenting that many of the restaurants and deals arenâ€™t worth the price. Here's a map that:
1. Visualizes participating restaurants
2. Brings together restaurant week offerings (price, menu, meal types) all in one place
3. Combines foodie recommendations and lists, chiefly Michelin, Bib Gourmand, and NYT Top 100 Restaurants, to help people identify restaurants worth visiting

Happy eating!
